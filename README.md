# What is this project?
A virtual machine transator which translates Hack VM language into Hack assembly
code. Completed as part of the nand2tetris part 2 course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/home/week/1). The Hack software architecture is designed similarily 
to Java, in which program written in the high-level language (Jack) are compiled to an
intermediary virtual machine code before being translated down to Hack assembly and finaly
assembled into hack machine code.
